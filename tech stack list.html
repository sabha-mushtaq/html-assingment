    <title>TECH STACK</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>TECH STACK</h1>
    <p>A tech stack refers to a set of tools, programming languages, and technologies that work together to build digital products or solutions such as websites, mobile, and web apps.

        A tech stack consists of two equally important elements: the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side). Both work together to create a working tech stack. This is also referred to as an application stack.
        
        While there are different tech stacks for web development, not all of them are created equally. The choice of an applicable tech stack can be challenging, particularly for startups and small businesses. They have limited budget and resources, thus, choosing the right tech stack is crucial to mobilize their software projects.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>1. LAMP</dt>
    <dd>LAMP is an industry-standard when it comes to tech stack models. In web development, it delivers the best cost efficiency, flexibility, and performance. It is an acronym that stands for:
<ul>
      <li> Linux (operating system)</li> 
      <li> Apache (HTTP server)</li> 
      <li> MySQL (relational database management)</li> 
      <li> PHP (programming language, it can also be Perl or Python)</li> 
    </ul>
        All these stack layers are free and open source. Since this tech stack can run on any operating system, you can interchange or modify other components in the same stack. Use WAMP for Microsoft Windows or MAMP for MacOS.</dd>
    

    <dt>2-ASP.NET</dt>
    <dd>Microsoft’s .NET Core has been growing in popularity in recent years. Modern .NET applications are very lightweight and can run on Windows and Linux. Microsoft’s embrace of open source technologies has caught the attention of developers all over the world. Now with .NET 5, you don’t have to think as much about .NET Framework vs .NET Core.

        Applications built using .NET commonly use the following application tech stack:
        <ul>
       <li> ASP.NET MVC – Standard model-view-controller framework
        <li> IIS – Microsoft’s web server</li>
        <li> Angular frontend framework with TypeScript</li>
        <li>  SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database</li>
        <li>  Microsoft Azure – A favorite of most .NET developers</li>
    </ul>
        It is also very common to also see .NET applications running on Linux with NGINX and open source databases like Postgresql or Mysql.</dd>

    <dt>3. MEAN</dt>
    <dd>Essentially MERN is similar to MEAN. The difference is that you change Angular.js with React.

    The key benefits of using MERN are the React integration, the ability to use code on browsers and servers simultaneously, powerful library, and full-stack development option (frontend and backend).
    
    Additionally, React is known for its flexibility and performance in developing interactive user interfaces.</dd>
