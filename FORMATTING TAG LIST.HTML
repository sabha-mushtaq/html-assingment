    <title>FORMATTING TAG LIST</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ol><li>HEADING TAG <ul>
<li>Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a table of contents for a document automatically.</li>
<li>Do not use heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS font-size propertyt</li>
<li>Do not skip heading levels: always start from h1, followed by h2 and so on.</li></ul>
 <li>[b tag]
        <ul>
            <li>The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance</li>
            <li>one should not use b for styling text or granting iThe </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> [p tag] <ul>
         <li>HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</li>
        <li>Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is parsed before the closing p tag. See "Tag omission" below.</li> </ul>
    <li>[i tag]
        <ul><li>The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i naming of this element.</li>
        <li>Use the i element for text that is set off from the normal prose for readability reasons. This would be a range of text with different semantic meaning than the surrounding text. Among the use cases for the i element are spans of text representing a different quality or mode of text</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li> [strong tag]
        <ul>
    <li>The strong HTML element indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.</li>
    <li>Typically this element is rendered by default using a bold font weight. However, it should not be used to apply bold styling; use the CSS font-weight property for that purpose. Use the b element to draw attention to certain text without indicating a higher level of importance. Use the em element to mark text that has stress emphasis.</li></ul>
</ol>
